# Lecture 2-28
## Exit Codes
- From stdlib.h -> EXIT_SUCCESS, EXIT_FAILURE
    + EXIT_SUCCESS = 0
    + EXIT_FAILURE = 1
- From sysexits.h -> EX_OSERR, EX_USAGE
    + These are used for invalid input usually
- Exit terminates the program -> not the same as return
    + Exit program using `exit(EXIT_SUCCESS)`
    + Function `exit` returns `void`

## Errors
- `errno` (error number) is the error variable
- `perror(str)` prints "Success" or "str"
    + "str" is printed if there was an error before `perror` was called
    + Relies on `errno`
- `strerror(errno)` prints the default message for the last error that occurred 

## Standard I/O
- `stdio.h` contains prototyps and constants for I\O routines
- Most I\O is stream-based and buffered to make things efficient
    + Can use the function `fflush()` to flush buffers immediately
- Two types of files:
    + Test streams
        * Composed of lines of test, each terminated by a newline
        * There are library functions to deal with test streams:
    + Binary files 
        * Composed of just plain data
- Line-oriented: `gets, fgets`
- Formatted: `scanf, sscanf, fscanf, printf, sprintf, fprintf`

### fopens example
```c
File *input; 
char filename[MAX_LEN], buffer[MAX_LEN];
printf("Input file name: "); 
scanf("%s", filenemae); 
if ((input = fopen(filename, "r")) == NULL) {
    perror("error opening file"); 
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
} else {
    while (fgets(buffer, MAX_LEN, input) != NULL) {
        printf("%s", buffer);
    }
    fclose(input);
    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS)
}
```
- File is opened and read, if "filename" doesn't exist `input` is NULL and the code exits with EXIT_FAILURE
- `fgets` reads the file line by line, and the lines are put into `buffer`
    + After a newline ('\n'), `fgets` puts '\0' at the end of `buffer`
- `buffer` is then printed, file is closed, and the program exits with EXIT_SUCCESS
- `fgets` returns NULL when you reach EOF
- In `fopen` the second argument represents the mode of opening: 
    + "r" = read file (file must exist)
    + "w" = writes file (overwrites if exists)
    + "a" = appends file (creates if doesn't exist)
-`fputs(const char *str, FILE *stream)` puts data in line by line

## Streams
- Three predefined streams: 
    + stdin: standard input (redirect with <)
    + stdout: standard output (redirect with >)
    + stderr: standard error
- `fprintf(FILE *stream, char *fmt, ...)` sends formatted output to stream
    + `printf("%s", str)` = `fprintf(stdout, "%s", str)`
- In shell, you can redirect stdout and stderr using >& (creates new file)
- `<Ctrl-D>` indicates EOF

### stdin as stream
```c
int main(int argc, int *argv[]) {
    FILE *input; 
    char line[MAX_LEN];

    input = stdin; /* sets input to the user input */
    fgets(line, MAX_LEN, input); /* reads a line */
    while (!feof(input)) {  /* checking for end of file */
        fputs(line, stdout); /*printing line to output */
        fgets(line, MAX_LEN, input); /* reads next line */
    }

    fclose(input);
    return(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
```
This time the file is just `stdin`. That means that the user will be entering input, which represents the file. This code will continue to read input until the user enters `<Ctrl-D>` to represent EOF.

## scanf
`int scanf(char *fmt, ...)`
- Reads formatted input from stdin
`int fscanf(FILE *stream, char *fmt, ...)`
- Reads formatted input from stream
`int sscanf(char str[], char *fmt, ...);`
- Reads formatted input from str

## printf
`int printf(char *fmt, ...);`

– Sends formatted output to stdout

`int fprintf(FILE *stream, char *fmt, ...);`

– Sends formatted output to stream

`int sprintf(char *buf, char *fmt, ...);`

– Formats output and places in buf, adding null byte

`int snprintf(char *buf, size_t limit, char *fmt, ...);`

– Writes at most limit - 1 characters to buf, then null byte
