## Structures

```c 
typedef struct two {
    char a; 
    int b; 
} s2; 
```

```
sizeof(s2) =/= 5
sizeof(s2) = 8
```

### Structure in Memory

| C | P | P | P | I | I | I | I |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|


- C represents the byte taken up by a character
- I represents bytes taken up by an int
- P represents the padding that exists
- || represents the spaces that can be accessed properly 
- Padding is empty space placed after some memory address so that variables will be aligned with certain memory addresses 

- You can use pointer arithmetic to access memory next to each other (such as in an array)
- Pointer arithmetic doesn't work with a structure because of the padding

- Sometimes we can order the elements of a ```struct``` to be memory efficient

### Example: 

| I | I | I | I | C | P | P | P |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

- Above there are a total of 5 bytes used instead of 8 as shown before

## #Declaring Structures

```c
struct {
    int id_number; 
    char last_name[10]; 
    char first_name[10]; 
    double salary; 
} emp1, emp2;
```
- Declares two variables (emp1 & emp2)
- You cannot declare any other variables of this type
- Omitting tag means you create a unique type for the variables listed
    + Even if member-lists are the same
    + Prevents use of those `structs` as function arguments

## Unions

- Similar to structures
- All fields share the same memory space, so are only as large as largest field
- Only one field valid at a time

```c
typedef union {
    int i; 
    double d; 
} Number; 
```

### Union in Memory

| I | I | I | I | P | P | P | P |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| D | D | D | D | D | D | D | D |

## Representing Characters

### Common Formats

- ASCII
    + The most commonly used character code
    + Uses 7 bits for characters (stored in 8 bits normally)
- EBCDIC
    + An 8-bit code, used now only by some IBM mainframes
- UNICODE 
    + Provides a unique number for every character
    + Different Representations
        * Basically lets you type in other languages
        * http://unicode.org for everything to know about UNICODE

## Signed/Unsigned

### Unsigned Integers

```c 
unsigned int y
printf("%ld\n", sizeof(unsigned int)); 
```
- Prints 4
- All data is stored in binary
- Generally used for bitwise operations

### Signed integers

- Signed integers are usually stored using two's complement
    + The leftmost bit indicates if a number is positive(0) or negative(1)
- To get the two's complement representation of a negative value, flip all the bits of the positive value and add 1. Example (8 bits):
    + (+)5 = 00000101 ---> (-)5 = 11111011
    + (+)3 = 00000011 ---> (-)3 = 11111101
    + Works because 00000101
- This helps for the addition of positive and negative numbers

### Signed/Unsigned Floats and Doubles

- A number can be represented as -1^s * m * r^@, where r is the radix
- Computers normally use a radix of 2
- IEEE 754 standard: 
    + First bit wil give you the sign (s), negative (1) or positive (0)
    + Next 8 will be exponent value (@)
        * For exponent you take how many bits exist on the left of the decimal in the mantissa and add 127 to it
    + The remaining 23 bits are the mantissa (m)
        * To compute, convert the part before decimal and part after decimal to binary 
        * The mantissa will look like XXX.xxx, and will be placed on the left of the mantissa bits and pad the rest with 0
- There is some imprecision because some decimals or large numbers cannot be properly represented with binary

## Misc

### Size of NULL
```c
printf("Size of NULL:%d\n", sizeof(NULL)); 
```
Above prints 8
```c 
NULL = (void *) 0 
```
Size of (void *) is 8

### SSH 
Switch grace machines with: ```$ ssh directory_id@graceX.umd.edu```, X = number of machine you want to use
