## Assembly Language Concepts

- Registers
    + Fast-access locations that the CPU uses rather than storing variables in memory
    + Y86 has 8 registers
- Memory
    + Program text resides here along with data that can't fit in registers

## Y86 Registers
- %eax, %ecx, %edx, %ebx, %esp, %ebp, %esi, %edi
- IDs for the above are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7
- %esp -> stack pointer
- %esb -> fram pointer
- ID 8 represents 'no register'

## Few Instructions

- `irmovl` -> copies a constant to a register (constant represent using '$')
- `rdch`   -> reads character
- `rdint`  -> reads integer
- `wrint`  -> writes an integer to standard output
- `wrch`   -> writes a character to standard output
- `halt`   -> stops the program
- `addl`   -> adds two values
- `subl`   -> subtracts two values
- `rrmovl` -> register to register copy

For Running a Program: 
- `yas`    -> assembles the machine code using Y86 assembler
- `yis`    -> executes the machine code using Y86 Simulator
